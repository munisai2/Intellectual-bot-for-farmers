# Intellectual-bot-for-farmers
About 40% of the population of India are farmers. 
They are expected to contribute 25% of GDP. But they could only contribute 13.9%. The government wants to fix this gap by doubling farmers annual income in the next five years. 
To achieve this, Access to information for farmers is very important. Keeping these points in mind, the government started Kissan Call Center (KCC). But due to high demand, it is only able to respond to 60% of calls. 
To overcome this problem, we need to think of an alternative. So for that, we are building an intellectual agent system with a prediction model.

In this project, we present our work on developing an agricultural chatbot to assist Indian farmers in resolving their queries. We obtained a dataset of queries and answers from the KCC and used it to train OpenAI's Davinci's text generation model to create the chatbot. 
To improve the chatbot's accuracy, we trained two other models, the LSI model and the Word2Vec Model. We are planning to integrate the chatbot into WhatsApp and Telegram to make it more accessible to farmers. 
Our chatbot can provide farmers with accurate information on farming practices, weather conditions, soil health, pest control, crop diseases, market prices, and government schemes related to agriculture. 
We have trained LSI and Word2Vec Models specifically on agricultural data of Ratnagiri district, Maharashtra and it can provide accurate answers to farmers' queries. Our chatbot is a valuable tool for farmers in India, and its integration into WhatsApp and Telegram reduces the pressure on the Kissan Call Center.
